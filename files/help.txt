Welcome to Hachi!
Hachi is your daily planner right here in your terminal!

Upon opening the app you will be presented with todays date, all events for today and a proverb to get you going!

The options can be navigated with your arrow keys. You have the option to:

Add:      allows you to add an event you just need to specify what day, what time, and give it a name.
Delete:   allows you to delete an event.
View:     allows you to view details of an event. You can view the events of a specific day or find an event with just its name!
Help:     will show you how to use this app.
Exit:     will close the planner.

Date can be entered as dd/mm/yyyy or just the days number and the month and year will
default to the current month and year.
All times must be entered in 24hr format.
